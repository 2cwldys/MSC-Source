Master Sword coded by Dogg - Kenneth Early

-Helpful Functions I put in:

int CBasePlayer::HandFromItem( CBasePlayerItem *pItem )
(Get a 0 or 1 (or -1 if not found) by specifying an Item)

CBaseEntity *FindEntityForward( CBaseEntity *pMe )
(I didn't put it in, but it's helpful!)

SpriteEffect( CBaseEntity *pEntity, int Effect, char *cSprite );
