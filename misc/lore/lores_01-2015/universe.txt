Maps:
[list]
[*]Map of Daragoth, as currently used by/planned for MS:C: [url=http://www.thothie.com/msc_dev3/msc_wip_map4d_full.gif]click[/url]
[*]Map of Daragoth, to be used in MS:S I think: [url=http://media.moddb.com/images/mods/1/12/11411/worldMap_prg15_f.jpg]click[/url]
[*]And just for fun, a really, really, [u]really[/u] old map of a part of Daragoth: [url=http://www.alaska.net/~articape/MS/BetaWorldMap.jpg]click[/url][/list]

Note: Some maps have several background stories. I'm not sure anymore which maps are 'official' and which are not, but if I removed everything that wasn't part of Lanethan's original plans, Wicard Oven, the Keledros business, the mines, Longroot, the Shadahar palace and even the Bloodrose mountains would have to go.

Also, unrelated: I wonder if they sell milk in bags in Kray Eldorad.
