<P><B>Apostles</B> <BR>In the world of MS, there are four primary =
'diety'
beings, which watch over the world and keep it in balance.&nbsp; They =
are of the
ancient Loreldian race, and are immortal. <BR>Each one of these =
Loreldians
represents a different side of 'Harmony,' as listed:
<P>Felewyn:&nbsp; Tall, green haired woman.&nbsp; She represents =
'Order,' or
'Good.'
<P>Torkalath:&nbsp; Grey haired, dark skinned man.&nbsp; Often appears =
as other,
more menacing, forms.&nbsp; He represents 'Chaos,' or 'Evil.'
<P>Urdual:&nbsp; Gentle faced, dark haired man.&nbsp; He represents =
'Balance,'
which means that when there is too much good in the world he creates =
chaos, and
when there's too much evil in the world he creates good.
<P>Pathos:&nbsp; True form unknown, often appears as a face split down =
the
middle: half of the face is benevolently smiling, the other half =
maliciously
frowning.&nbsp; He represents 'Duality,' as he has both an 'Order' side =
and a
'Chaos' side.
<P>All of these Loreldians serve the same force: to create Harmony, a =
balance
between both good and evil.&nbsp; Pathos watches over the other three to =
keep
them from becoming unbalanced. <BR>For these Loreldians to appear in the =

physical plane is nearly impossible, and almost always undesirable as it =
creates
severe unbalance in the fate of the world.&nbsp; Thus, they have each
<BR>selected 'Apostles' to represent them: near immortal, they can pass =
freely
between the astral and physical planes of existence.&nbsp; These =
'Apostles'
enforce/represent the Loreldians in <BR>the physical plane, and harbor =
in
themselves immense power.&nbsp; The current list of apostles is as =
follows:
<P>Felewyn- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tungar:&nbsp;&nbsp; =
An
almost purely mental essence that drifts across the lands, it holds a =
somewhat
loose alliance to Felewyn when
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
light needs to be restored to a darkened area. Knowledge of this apostle =
is
largly taken in good faith as no one has yet seen Tungar in its physical =
form,
or if in fact
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
there is a physical form. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =

Akanli:&nbsp;&nbsp; A stout dwarven warrior with golden hair, some say =
he
appears as a giant wielding a crystalline axe.&nbsp; It has been a long =
time
since he has apparated. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>Urdual-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myrlance:&nbsp; The balancer of =
war, he
seeks unnatural gaps that may appear in the souls of warriors.
<P>Torkalath- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurgoth:&nbsp; =
Once an
elf named Cristiel, his physical form has been warped, representing the =
pure
evil which glows inside his black heart.
<P>Pathos- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lanethan:&nbsp; Once =
an elf
named Aginor, Lanethan used to be an apostle of Felewyn.&nbsp; Now he =
represents
the 'Order' half of Pathos. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Iquitas:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister of Idemark (who was =
previously
Pathos' Order apostle), she represents the 'Chaos' half of Pathos. =
<BR>????-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lostman:&nbsp; A wandering, =
seemingly
lost, man.&nbsp; It is unknown what power he serves. <BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Apostle Equipment</B> <BR>Created for the apostles, this equipment =

(through the terrible power of the 'Lost') has fallen into players' =
hands.&nbsp;
Failure to remove and dispose of this equipment upon being asked <BR>can =
and
will often result in a permanent ban from the game of Mastersword as of =
the next
patch. <BR>Apostle equipment is as follows: <BR>"The Asderal =
Blade"&nbsp;
-&nbsp; A golden longsword. <BR>"The Dread Scythe"&nbsp; -&nbsp; A =
large, red
scythe <BR>"Lanethan's Bow"&nbsp; -&nbsp; A jeweled bow <BR>"Dark =
Apostle Armor"
-&nbsp;&nbsp; Armor which looks a little like 'The Grim Reaper' =
<BR>"Light
Apostle Armor" -&nbsp; Armor which looks very white and has a hooded =
face.
<P>All other equipment is sanctioned.&nbsp; Any instances of players =
using this
equipment should be reported to <A
href=3D"mailto:wintermute@cvinternet.net">wintermute@cvinternet.net</A>&n=
bsp; with
the name of the offender. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; =
