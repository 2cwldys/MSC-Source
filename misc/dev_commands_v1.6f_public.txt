		Requirements: 400 HP, 90 minutes of playtime. You can name the items yourself, as is shown.

========================================================================================================

HOW TO SPAWN NPCs THAT AREN'T PRECACHED BY DEFAULT:

Set the following variable in listenserver.cfg or server.cfg to precache NPCs:

		ms_dynamicnpc "scriptname1;scriptname2;scriptname3;scriptname4;scriptname5;"

Example:

		ms_dynamicnpc "monsters/sgoblin;monsters/k_hollow_one;monsters/beetle_fire_giant;"

NOTE 1: The input must end with a semi-colon!
NOTE 2: If you precache a lot of NPCs and attempt to type ms_dynamicnpc in-game, in the console,
        hl.exe will freeze because the input is too long. However, there are no other side effects
        and you can still spawn monsters.

After setting the variable, go in-game and type:

		createdyn "[integer]"

Example:

		createdyn 0				spawn a shadow goblin
		createdyn 1				spawn a Kharaztorant hollow one
		createdyn 2				spawn a giant fire beetle

NOTE 3: The amount of NPCs you can precache depends on the total length of the input and therefore
        on the lengths of the scriptnames.
NOTE 4: Some maps won't load if you precache too many monsters.
