Re: List of changelogs

MAR2008a PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

spiderz.gif

New Stuffz
• console/chat command: listpoints
- List damage points of all players present in order from most to least
- Figure this maybe more useful than /roll when fighting over treasure
• Bludgeon Hammer
- The most redundantly named blunt evah, has the soul of its original owner sealed within
- Right-click to tap into its powah for the bludgeon demon rage (req prof: 20)
- One hand for them, two hands for you, the weapon has four charges per map run at twenty seconds each. Use them wisely as "retry" will not restore them

New Monsters
• monsters/eagle
- Nasty lil bugger flies all over the place, attacks from above, probably suitable for 200-400hp range, lest you use them in groups, wildanimal faction
- additional parameter: start_perched- use this and the eagle will stay perched and idle until someone comes within 384 units and in its field of vision, or it is attacked
- Variants in order from weakest to meanest (est. level 300-800hp, all demon faction):
- monsters/eagle_plague - disease spreading, some knock back
- monsters/eagle_demon - fire effects, some knock back
- monsters/eagle_ice - ice effects, some knock back
- monsters/eagle_stone - damage reduct, lots of knock back
- monsters/eagle_metal - heavy damage reduct, lots of knock back, stun attacks
• monsters/fire_reaver
- Level 40+ miniboss
- This walking volcano packs a wallop and has guided explosive balls o' fire to boot

Mappper toys
• Lures now accept critical_npc param, and use the hpmulti property
• additional parameters: make_sleeper and make_deep_sleeper
- Works on most skeletons, make_sleeper skeletons play dead until someone comes near
- make_deep_sleeper require ms_npcscript event skeleton_wakeup_call or spawning of monsters/skels_wakeup to arise from slumber
- stone skeletons act like statues instead of sleeping on their faces
- see skeleton_wakeup_call in previous changelog entries for further usage
• additional parameter: make_fade_in
- Makes monster fade in on spawn - good for a less jarring spawn effect, when you have to spawn the monster near the player
• other/trigger_burn - trigger brush scriptname
- Same as other/burn_1000, but you can determine the exact damage by setting the target property (eg. target 100 for 100dmg/sec)

Map Updates
• Lodagond-1 (Recompile)
- Edict optimization, new boss chamber (easier in some ways, harder in others), and several minor tweaks, plus a link to Lodagond-2
• Chapel (ripent)
- Fixed light sequence
• Calruin2 (hlcsg/ripent)
- Fixed bit with bats getting stuck in rotating chains
• mscaves (Recompile)
- Fixed bit where Fire Reaver would spawn regardless of HP present (req. 3000hp)
- Also gave him some headroom

Bug Fixes, and Such
• Fixed unselectable character with scroll bars bug (Thank Shurik3n!)
• Fixed "that annoying seizure-when-crouching-on-entities bug" (Thank MiB!)
• System for altering viewmodel skins/submodelbody/render in place (Bow down and worship Shurik3n!)
• Slight improvements to the fish AI
• Demonclaws: Soul Fist attack no longer drain on miss, nor when striking a player outside of PVP
- They also drain a max of 50% mana, but do x3 damage, instead of x2
• Fixed some issues with scriptname brush trigger: other/totalhp_trigger
- This trigger goes off only once now, and responds proper
- If it is touched by someone not meeting the HP req's, it'll still remove itself
• Massive edict improvements for lodagond/maldora and lodagond/maldora_fragment
• Fixed Alpha Winter Wolf Boss using wrong skin / glow colors
• Fixed some bugs with some projectile throwers (stone skeletons, ice lobbers)
• monsters/ice_mage - Will now use monsters/sorc_telepointX, if present, to get closer to an opponent (see monsters/sorc_chief1 entry)
• Some edict optimization on the scroll system
• Edict optimization on some lightning throwing monsters
• Support for Lodagond-2, 3, and 4
• Support for Gertenheld_Forest
• New Elemental resistance system
- Resistances stack, even those for the same element, and across potions, armors, weapons, items, etc.
- If you resist an elemental effect, that resistance carries over against subsequent attacks of the same element for 10 seconds
