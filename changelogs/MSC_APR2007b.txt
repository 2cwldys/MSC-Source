Re: List of changelogs

APR2007b PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

• No more XP loss for PvP kills (hopefully)
• Some semi-effective attempts at fixing the XP system
• Bloodrose Script Fixes
- Atholo death
- HP trigger roaming
- Rebalance Atholo, some AI enhancement, dynamic step size (makes him fly a bit)
- Elemental Crystal Triggers re-write (now uses crystal model, affected by all valid spells)
- Flesh Eater Premature Pre-Death Bug
- Findlebind Chat bugs
- Standard rattlers are back to wildanimal faction so they don't eat boars (larger ones on the other hand...)
- Stone trap 'play everywhere' enhancement
- Better range capping on Venevus spells
= (he can still cast damn far, and through walls, but this is deliberate)
- Added Cheerleader Ryza to help deal with Atholo sploitz
- Treasure boost
• Thornlands has bloodrose transition
- Traditionalists may not wish to add Bloodrose to the custommap list due to this
- Also swapped Heras/Mscave transitions pending expansion + match world map
• Some AI changes
- Better awareness when a monster is swinging but still can't hit you
- Should no longer attack firewalls / poison clouds
• Map Nazi Fixes (partly MS.DLL change, eliminates case sensitivity issues for maps/transitions)
- Transitioning to and from gauntlet/boss maps should no longer be a problem
- If you crash on a gauntlet map, you should still be considered valid on rejoin, if you came from a valid map
- (Technically, you'll be considered valid so long as you don't touch a transition on another map)
• Skycastle Chest Fix #2329
- Once again, works fine for me, this all new method should *hopefully* be more dependable
- If the chests don't show up on your server, check the modified date on the BSP
- if it isn't recent, you have issues. Please contact so we can see why map is not updating
• Map Fix for Keledrosruins
- No more getting stuck around those library pillars
• Improved Keledros responsiveness while 'waiting for visitors'
- Also set it up so he doesn't go non-solid while faking death and get peeps stuck inside of him
- Keledros no longer uses death magic, instead, his spells have priority over players, in the event of spam flood
- Can we go one patch without having to fix Keledros?
• New bandit: monsters/bandit_mage
- Weakest of the bandit mages. This one casts Ice Shield on allies and throws fire-darts.
- May appear randomly in Keledrosprelude2 or during Helena raids (or with use of monsters/bandit random gen)
• Fixed rock-throwing goblins throwing fire darts
• Revamped Lightning Storm
- Lightning Storm is now a sustained spell that slowly drains mana
- It will reposition itself where you are looking whenever you fire, it will damage anything its beams strike
- XP passing is improved, but still not perfect
• Enhanced the hud based health feedback
- show_health 1 is still not a real cvar, as I didn't want to mess with the client.dll until next month (prefer "B" patches to be server side, if at all possible)
- Color coded bars included in feedback. Can also be used if you get the 'colorless' hud bug (new version of the scrolling negative)
- Gives feedback while resting + alert on full heal.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Your character may turn transparent, or even invisible, on your client, when dawning new armor. Other players may see you as "animated Armor" - death fixes
= ( This is due to me playing with possible armor fixes )
- Bandit mage sometimes goes BD
