Re: List of changelogs

SEP2007a BETA PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

SEP2007a_centerfold.gif

New Stuff (All in game)
• Lighting Arrows - Arrows enchanted with lightning
• Armor of Bravery - This armor negates death penalties and provides a fair amount of protection from death to boot (Thank Belmont)
• Gladiator Armor - Nearly the protection of Knights for half the weight Plate, plus nifty spikes to boot. (Thank Gaz!)
• Helm of the Dead - First person to figure out what this does gets a cookie! (Thank Cerix)

New Mapper Toys
• New msmonster_XXXX/ms_npc property: hpmulti
- Multiplies the monsters base HP by this amount (if > 1)
• New msmonster_XXXX/ms_npc property: dmgmulti
- Multiplies the monster DMG by this amount (if > 1)
- These two combined with title allow you to more or less make your own l337 monsters
- XP can be increased after FN approval
• monsters/sorc_intro
- Something for Crow, will PM with a map demonstrating its use.

BugZ Squashed + Odder stuffz
• More tweakage to the rampage and level requirement systems
• Weapons you don't make the level requirement can still be swung, but damage/tohit% is reduced
• Blood Axe realigned (Thank Shuriken/Orochi)
• Urdual Shield on proper joint (Thank Shuriken/Orochi)
• Wild and untested stab at the overflow bug by MiB.

New Supported Maps
• Ara - Use the Deralia boat to travel to the port town of Ara, which is having a slight orc invasion problem. (Mid level map by J): LINKY
• Chapel - Winding wilderness conceals a fallen temple of an unknown god. Very low level map, save for a hidden giant bat, but has enough secrets to keep the veterans exploring it for awhile too. (Chapel will eventually connect to Edana Sewers) LINKY

...and about 10,000 other minor fixes I'm not bothering to mention.

Shortest changelog, evah, for the biggest patch ever: 40MB! :oldshock: - We REALLY need an installer. :\
