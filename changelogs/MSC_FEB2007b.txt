Re: List of changelogs

FEB2007b Betapackage

This is a supplemental update, it isn't critical. If you play on a FEB2007a server with this patch, there are only two potential items you could lose (see below) so you should be relatively safe.

Originally it was going to be nothing but server-side bug fixes, but I all you guys really want is more items and maps, so... ;)

Bug Fixes
• MS.DLL - now defaults to the non-SSE2 enabled version. Versions with SSE1 and SSE2 enhanced instruction sets are included in the dlls folder for those who want them.
• Dated clients no longer crash when they level (although they may still crash if they see someone with the "A" patch level.)
• Dated clients should no longer crash on new weather changes
• Further efforts to fix the occasional No Free Edict from fireball/dart bug.
• Chain Lightning now does damage.
• Bats drop down
• Zombie quest counter fixed.
• Bone Blade not heals against all monsters (save for undead, as per usual)
• Ice Djinn will hopefully not ignore monster clips
• Skycastle chests security altered
• Orc brawlers should stay frozen when struck by greater ice blade.
• Fixed some precache hitwall sound errors.
• Blizzard/Ice Storm now visible indoors.
• Lures should not get glowshells when struck by elemental magic
• Weather should reset between maps

New Stuff
• Potion of Regeneration (in game)
- Rapid healing for around 5 minutes.
• Bottle of Vampire Blood (in game)
- Read the warning label - note on some maps, it applies to anywhere during the day. ;)
- Lasts about 5 minutes. Does not work against undead.

New Monsters
• monsters/zombie - Like decayed zombie, but... not so decayed. (in game)
• monsters/zombie_huge - Remember Fred? (in game)
• monsters/skeleton_stone1
- weakest of the pending Stone Skeleton series - fast moving, damage resistant bastard with sword and shield. (in game)
• monsters/skeleton_ice - not new, but now has a shotgun. ^_^
• All the enraged skeletons (save the weakest) have a new model that favors the ability to run over speeding up the animation that caused the odd lag effect. (Specifically: Enraged Poisoner, and Enraged Ice Skeleton)
• Miniboss Minions ( monsters/flesheaterminion and monsters/bloodreaverminion ) have been moved to the "smart" model and are thus now much more frightening.
• heras/GhorAsh - moved to "smart" skeleton model, and is now fleet of foot as well.

Installer Changes
• Better feedback on the map update batch file.

Lots of other minor changes.

Stuff that didn't get done:
- I'd have to delay this another day to get you the AMX fix, but I'll release it as a separate AMX update when I get it working.
- Shaddarh refuses to play nice with his COD under the new model... So maybe we'll go with laser eyes later. ;)
