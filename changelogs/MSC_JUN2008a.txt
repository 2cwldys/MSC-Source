Re: List of changelogs

JUN2008a PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

• You can now store your pets safely out of the way by unsummoning them (F11 menu, or click on the pet)
• Pets level up a bit more like players now
- Pets require the creature they kill has at least 10% of their XP
- So you can only level up on rats so long before you must move on to boars, etc.
• Pets anti-suicide system
- Pets teleport to player if they fall. They also stick to the player a bit better than they used to, and have slightly improved navigation
• Support for Isle by CSS
• Open support for future maps
• Several training sploits patched up (both for pets and people)
• XP multipliers on Lodagond are nixed, and the better treasure shifted to the end.
• Parry is capped at 40
- This should cut down on parry whoring, and serve as a go-between step for removal of the stat
- This will also allow very high level characters to alter their title, pending title system
• ...and the usual 100,000 changes I'm not bothering to list
