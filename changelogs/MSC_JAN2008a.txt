Re: List of changelogs

JAN2008a BETA PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

Almost a B patch this year, but we're fixin everything that broke in DEC2007a - and lots of other stuff that broke before that.

New Stuffs
• Internal Map Vote System
- Type votemap in chat or console.
- No more fuxing with buggy AMX/X builds
- ATM, you can vote for any map, save those that are in gauntlet series, within mazes, or otherwise hidden
- more restrictive map voting options will be available via server vars in the future
- You can only vote for FN approved maps
- Uses AMX delayed reconnect map crash fix, and crashed.cfg updating
- AMX votemap plugin is included, and has been modded to play nice with it
- Nice clean list of maps not connected to the world displays in console for ease of reference
• Wipe individual spells (Thank MIB!)
- You can go visit Torwhodoc, and for his usual exuberant charge, he can wipe specific spells from your list.
- Eventually the Potion of Forgetfulness will work this same way (and likely take over the job.)
