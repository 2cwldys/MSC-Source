- Secondary effects damage will pass XP proper, more often
- Less likely to crash from 'overlapping damage'
- Some lag reduction.

This affects:
- Poison (et. al: spell, fangtooth, arrows)
- Ice Spells that do continuous damage (ie. Blizzard, Ice Blade spec atk)
- Fire Spells and Arrows (though volcano & firewall still do not pass to proper skill)
- Lightning Storm
