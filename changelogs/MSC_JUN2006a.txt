Re: List of changelogs

June 02nd 2006 Public Changelog

Minor update to the server today, it only affects those of you who summong rats, and have Spell Casting above 7.

The giant rats you l337 casters summon were causing server crashes due to a boffo screw up on my part (again, why this patch is not on the main downloads page).

You *may* need to update your own sc.dll to be able to summon giant rats again without making either you or the server go *poof*.
