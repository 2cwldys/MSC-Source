Re: List of changelogs

October 1st 2006 Public Changelog

Public Changelog:
New Stuffz
Summoned Skeletons now upgrade armor/weaponry based on your SC level.
Helmets actually do something now! (stun resistance %)
Future helmets may do more interestin stuff.
The Light XBOW is in - seek and ye shall find (prob needs some balance/bug tweaks still)
More XBow types to come... All bolts are in game too, but you'll have to hunt them down. (Scattered)
Snake Staff - available, but not officially in yet
Bone Blade - ditto
The Spiderblade - New sword for eight legged creepies

New Beasties
monsters/snake_sidewinder
- poisonous rattler
monsters/snake_gsidewinder
- same thing, but bigger
monsters/snake_gcobra
- giant cobra... Similar 'trap' concept as the regular cobra, but harder not to set off. (sleeps coiled)
monsters/snake_lord
- Silthar (level 25 miniboss), snake summoning bastard and apprentice to Venevus
monsters/snake_cursed
- One-shot snakes summoned by snake summoning bastard.
monsters/skeleton_poison_bolter
- "Envenomed Bones" shoots poisoned bolts (same as Horror's but < damage). Unlike the frost bolters, he only shoots at the player he is facing, rather than all enemies in a radius.
monsters/skeleton_poison_vamper
- "Vampyric Poisoner" has a Bone Blade that lets him regen per-hit
monsters/skeleton_poison_bomber
- "Poisoned Spore" explodes into a poison cloud if struck hard enough or low enough on HP
monsters/skeleton_poison_sworder
- "Envenomed Blade" for two types of extra damage (non-roamer)
monsters/skeleton_poison_rager
- "Enraged Poisoner" on crack with poison axes - not quite the same quality of crack that the Enraged Ice Bone is on, but still fast
monsters/skeleton_poison_guarder
- "Poisonus Guardian" slow moving, low damage, high armor skeleton that periodically surrounds himself with poison fog. (non-roamer)
monsters/skeleton_poison_random
- picks one of the above 6 at random - not a bad idea, as they tend to complement each other, and it adds to variety per map visit. Guardian and Sworder will go roaming if spawned through this random script.
* Poison bone series intended for levels 20-30 (depending on how many you use at once)
bloodrose/venevus
- "Venevus the Corruptor" yet another necro modeled after Keledros (just to piss off davidos.)

New Mapper Toys
shards / key / and related NPC for Crow's map
dq/findlebind <-> kodiak -> slithar -> venevus bloodrose quest package worked out
go_roam - ms_npcscript event, makes a non-roaming monster start roaming
no_roam - ms_npcscript event, sets a roaming monster into guard mode

BugZ Squashed + Odder stuffz
More optimization for the new AI (no longer high-cycles vs. mons/sounds)
Old AI given the 'alert allies on struck' ability (but not on spot)
Pot tweakage
Bandit screwups from September fixed
Orc Flayer screwups from September fixed
*some* improvement to the flyer AI (currently affects most bats and Horrors)
No more invulnerable low-flying horrors (sadly, horror death sequence also nerfed) [includes model fix]
BS BD mitigated, but something odd is still going on there
Sembelbin High Priest chat fixed, and much more chat added.
Forsuth chat fixed and his constant nodding (hopefully once and for all)
Default NPC menus - wander around and F11 on some random NPC's - ye may even learn somethin new! ;)

...and the usual 10,000 minor changes I'm not bothering to list...
