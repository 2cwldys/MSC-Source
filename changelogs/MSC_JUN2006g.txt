I made some drastic lag reduction steps... base_npc_attack.script - which every monster uses - has not one, but two procedures that repeat every 1/10th a second, one of which is rather complex. I consolidated those two under a single routine. Further, I switched it up so that it only repeats once every thee seconds, until they spot a player, at which time it switches back to every 1/10th second - but just for the monster so activated.

This may make monsters a little slower to respond to your presence, but doesn't seem too obnoxious.

Another bit that makes monsters slow to respond sometimes, is that if you go out of sight, they change their hunt method - sometimes they find you, and rub up against you for a second or two before they switch back to attack mode, I've noticed. Probably still worth it for the better hunting ability, but I will try to find away around. Note that monsters can't 'see' through each other - so this is more noticeable in monster hairballs.

Monsters will not change their cycle time for other monsters, only players, so this might help on Daragoth. There is a WHOLE lot of action going on in Daragoth you never see... Seriously, been watching the debug report where I've got monsters reporting what they are doing - it is t3h insane - goblins killing spiders, bears killing spiders, trolls killing boars - there's a full scale war the poor server is keeping track of before you ever even join the map!

Similarly, monsters will not start stuck checks before they see a player. So you *may* still occasionally see two monsters stuck together (usually due to the bjorked monsterspawn system that I've no control over) however - they should unstuck themselves pretty quick upon spotting you.
