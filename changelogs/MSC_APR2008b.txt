Re: List of changelogs

APR2008b MANDATORY SERVER SIDE PATCH CHANGELOG:

• New chat/console command: /stuck
- Use this if you get stuck at a spawn, it'll move you to another spawn point (if any exist)
- Only works within 128 units of initial spawn
• Fixed treasure sploit in mscave
- Hence the mandatoryness
• Fixed boss damage resistances
• Altered AI and movement type on sharks for smoother swimming
- They will also TRY to stay in the water, if placed without a monsterclip, but the monsterclip is still recommended
- Placing a monsters/fish_shark outside of water will result in brain death - don't do it. ;)
• Switched Arti-Chests to offer one random duplicate to players who already have all items
• Fixed some issues with Blood Drinker [some of which is client side]
• Moar CPU optimization on the newer AI and anti-stuck function
• Oceancrossing can be reached through Captain Charon at Deralia's port
• Oceancrossing: fixed bit where players sometimes spawned in middle of boat
• Fixed bug with mscvote_map_type "root"
• Fixed bug where transitions didn't take you to proper spawn points
- via mega-h4x, so may need testing
