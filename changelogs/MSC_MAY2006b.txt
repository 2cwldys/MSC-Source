Re: List of changelogs

May 20th 2006 Public Changelog

- Shields Work (May need some nerfing)
- Blizzard, Lightning Storm, Firewall, and Volcano all work (properly)
- New spells currently available: Poison, Fire Ball
- Blizzard Raises Ice skill, Poison Raises Affliction
- Ice shield blocks 50% of all incoming damage for ~30secs, for 50 mana - this stacks with armor and shield effects. Ice Shield also works on pets.
- Summoned pets do damage (Summoned Pets Skill is based on SC)
- Summoned pets respond to commands (hunt, follow, kill, status, vanish - and a few other commands unique to each monster) - must use NPC speak, and must be in range.
- Summoned Rats upgrade to summoned Giant Rats at SC 8 (doing something similar for skeleton later)
- All known quests should now function
- Healing rate is now 5% of your max health, 20% of your max mana per tick (minimum 2pts/4pts). This means everyone should heal at about the same rate regardless of level. Also hoping this discourages character deletes from mass potion haulers / lag from rejuv abuse. You will not be able to heal for a few moments after being struck.
- Mana pots should be more useful, though I keep forgetting to actually test that.
- Anti-spam system to prevent No Free Edict errors (refined as of 5/20)
- 99.9% MS 1.35 Compatible (note: some old MS maps also require wad files not found in MSC, and map behavior may still be quite buggy.)
- MANY bugged treasure chests fixed, there are many items out there you may have missed. (Largely due to [=>] != [>=])
- Elven swords each uniquely named (and sword_bastard, is now actually a bastard sword, instead of the weakest elven sword under the wrong name)
- Search the sewers for some new friends.

-> Beware there is an eight spell limit (working on this, may have new spell casting method entirely)

Mappers should read the full change log on the patches page. There are now time and weather control features available.

There's also a new ms.dll running on the server (hence the 'dev_h') - but there are no changes to speak of there yet - it's basically testing the recompile for solidity.
