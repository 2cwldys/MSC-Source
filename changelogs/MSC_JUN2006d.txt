Re: List of changelogs

June 12th 2006 Public Changelog

For those of you running AMX and Keledrosprelude2. here's the change to the AMX voting system to allow voting for that:
http://www.thothie.com/ms/adminvote.amx
(That goes in msc/addons/amx/plugins , overwrite original)

That now is included with the Keledrosprelude2 map, which has had a minor bug fix or two:

self installer: http://www.thothie.com/ms/keledrosprelu ... taller.zip

Finally the SC.dll has had a v. minor update:
- Fixed summoning cap (again)
- Longsword player anims
- Djinn should no longer get stuck on own summons
- Djinn should summon ice trolls 15-30 secs apart
- Djinn a little less 'pushy' - but instead does a major launch once in awhile.
- Djinn no longer freezing people he did not hit.
- Orochi's Scimitar viewmodel now inside the dll package
- Several other minor fixes

Still working on balancing the rejuv - but dun worry... Tis not the 1hp/second I had on my server for a bit. Current system is 10+Divination Skill HP healed / Strike @ 5 mana ea. Tis still a little over-nerfed, but on the plus side, it's lag-free, so should encourage healing other players more.
