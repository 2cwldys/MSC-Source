Re: List of changelogs

AMX_WARNING said:
WARNING TO SERVER HOSTS USING AMX
You MUST remove adminvote.amx from your msc/addons/amx/config/plugins.ini or bad things will happen!

- We’re still allowing AMX for now, as we’ve yet to add some new features to the MSC replacement (such as MOTD) – but the current vote systems are not compatible with AMX nor MODX installs

Also setup your admins.txt and the new cvars as desired; described below:

FEB2008a / MSC 1.11 PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

• FULL RELEASE!

New Server Cvars
msvote_farm_all_day 0 - Allow voting for the map the players are on
msvote_map_type "all" - (all|root) - allow voting for all maps (save hidden/gauntlet/maze) or restrict to only root towns
msvote_map_enable 1 - allow voting for maps
msvote_kick_enable 1 - allow votekick from chat
msvote_ban_enable 1 - allow voteban from chat
msvote_ban_time 60 - time to ban person voted banned (0 = permanent)
msvote_pvp_enable 1 - allow vote for pvp (pvp mode will engage/end 10/60 seconds after vote)
ms_chatlog 1 - log chat and various server events to monthly chat log
ms_admin_contact "[none given]" - Place e-mail contact here, it will appear to kicked/banned players or when players type 'contact' in console
ms_ban_to_cfg 1 - Write permanent bans to server.cfg/listenserver.cfg so they stay permanent
- if this is set 0, the bans will only be written to ms_bans.cfg, which you can add to your server config via "exec ms_bans.cfg"

Server reset system:
ms_timelimit 0 - (Old cvar, modified) changes map to Edana this many minutes after the last player leaves, if server is still empty (also writes crashed.cfg)
ms_reset_if_empty 0 - If set to 1, instead of switching to Edana, write edana to the crashed.cfg and restart (quit) the server. (Helps keep server fresh)

Admin System
Add steam ID's to msc/admins.txt to setup your admins
Loopback IP always has admin access
Commands:
• admin_help - list commands (more or less shows this text:)
• admin_listbans - list permanent bans
• admin_unban - <steamid|playername> - removes ban line from .cfgs and banlist
• admin_ban - <playername|steamid|#statusidx> [minutes] [reason]
• admin_kick - <playername|steamid|#statusidx> [reason]
• admin_map - changelevel (any map)
• admin_say - "yourmessage" speech infomsg through the Game Master – use "quotes"
• admin_vote "option1;option2;option3" "Vote,Title "Vote,Description"
- general vote, use "quotes", use semi-colons (;) to separate options
• admin_votemap - Votemap (any map)

Note: “playername” can be partial. #statusidx, refers to the # reported on the left when you type “status” in console.

Extended admin commands:
• admin_cvar <variable> <setting>
- Only admins.txt with “cvar” or “rcon” after their Steam ID admins.txt have access to this command
• admin_rcon "<commands>" (use quotes)
- Only admins.txt with “rcon” after their Steam ID in admins.txt have access to this command

Player Initiate Votes
• Ye Votemap system has been enhanced
• votekick <playername|steamid|#statusidx>
- in console or chat (although you’ll have to toggle off the console to actually vote)
• voteban <playername|steamid|#statusidx>
- in console or chat ( " " )
- Duration for player initiated votebans is determined by msvote_ban_time
• votepvp
- Toggles PVP mode (untested)
- Should work in the same map, has a countdown timer.
- Does not change the ms_pklevel cvar, so it will reset after map change.

Map Changes
• Mscave (recompile)
- Optimized map spawn sequences, added new Shaddarh spawn sequence and place holders for his new hide-and-seek game.
- Added hpreq monsters and more treasure to go with them.
- Added new transitions (one placeholder, one for sewerrride)
• Helena (recompile)
- Fixed a few v.minor glitches
- Added transition to Demontemple
- Some edict reduction efforts
• Old Helena
- Active monster reduction efforts
- Spawn counter fixes
- Monsters should just keep spawning forever, and you’ll be cued for a new wave when a bunch of orcs mysteriously “vanish”
• Demontemple
- Connected to Helena
- Placeholder for hidden Kharaztorant Title quest
• Daragoth (recompile)
- Fixed bug where trolls couldn’t see you in huts (although now they have no qualms about punching you straight through them – but hey, they’re hay).
- Fixed bug where some monsters couldn’t climb the lip of the entrance to the huts
- Fixed bug where goblins and keeper couldn’t see you if you ducked in the water
- Fixed all buggy textures in Daragoth.wad (think most all of them were there)
- Few other minor changes
• Chapel (recompile)

- Fixed church sequence not running through and tweaked it up a bit
- New treasure layout

New Beasties
• monsters/wolf_ice (now works, thank MiB)- Winter wolf
- Winter wolf minions (30+) with freezing howl
• monsters/wolf_ice_alpha (now works, thank MiB) - Winter Alpha Wolf
- Ice wolf boss (40+)
- Summons uber blizzard (800 radius) at monster location or at the location of other/summon_point1 - if the script is present
- Also casts ice shield

New Mapper Toys
• Additional monster param: start_running
- Monster will spawn using it’s running animation, and be fully “cycled up”
- (Useful when you know the monster is going to spawn right next to the player or needs to run forward a bit to immediately join a battle)

Bug Fixes, and Such
• Some projectiles having more gravity that they should
• Ice Shield taking mana even with target shielded
• Toned town the votemap graphic spam (reports to combat hud instead of popups)
- Ditto on the party leave/join
• Animated armors resistances
• Massive changes in XP on bosses in certain situations
• Potions of stability crashing server (cross fingers)
• Lesser ice shield not being so lesser
• Demon claws give martial arts XP for speed and soul drain attacks, and will not play anim when out of mana
- Also no more "No target", thing - if ye miss, ye miss
• Some reduction of lag when choosing a character
• Various efforts to fix crashes via scripts on both Helena’s
• Some edict reduction attempts (<- We need to get serious about this!)
• New lightning system means lights stay bright in the dark
- PS. No, that is NOT the new lighting system you’ve been seeing on the ultra-beta server, it requires this client patch to get the full effect
- We may need to tweak this some yet ^_^
• Potion of Forgetfulness now lets you forget individual spells
- It's no longer Torwhodoc's job (or he forgot it was) - ya gotta find/purchase the pot
- Fixed a bug where certain spells could not be forgotten
• Fixed some potential issues with the gauntlet system
• HP/MAXHP now appears on Scoreboard and Serverinfo screens (Thank Shuriken!)
• Yet moar anti-cheat security (Thank MIB!)
• More robust FN communication potential (experimental, Thank MiB!)

And the usually 100,000 changes I’m not bothering to list (actually, more like 200,000 this time.)
