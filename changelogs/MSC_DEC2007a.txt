Re: List of changelogs

DEC2007a BETA PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

New Maps
• Helena
- Helena has been recompiled and re-optimized. It now contains two seperate cave mini-dungeons. May expand further, if the edicts play nice.
• Old Helena (30+)
- Find the wizard to send you back in time to this classic MS 1.35 map with some new MSC twists.
- Old Helena can ONLY be reached via the wizard in Helena
• Gertenheld_Cape by Dridje
- This low-level multi-quest lighthouse map can be reached from Deralia
(LostCaverns by Jon should be available soon, but I do not have the final version)

New Stuffs
• Light Crystals
- This quest item can be broken in an emergency. It will blind all nearby players, but also nearby monsters.
• Heavy Crossbow
- AKA. "Old Iron Sights" - load up steel or dwarven bolts and send em into oblivion, or setup with some blesseds and lay down the wrath of the divine
• Healing Circle
- A stationary magic circle that heals you and your allies so long as you remain within it
• Ice Dagger (Thank MiB & Sabre)
- A Dagger... of Ice. (aka. Litch Tongue) - Freezing burst on secondary charge attack
• Northmaul
- This mighty hammer of ice can be swiveled and thus the backside used to switch from elemental ice damage to vicious piercing damage
- This can be handy when dealing with sets of elemental gay rainbow armor and other mixed elemental sets where some may resist cold and others maybe vulnerable to it
- In addition the Northmaul can summon blizzards and waves of ice via the third and forth stage charges
• Potion of Stability
- Three minutes of immunity to both push and stun
- Give Thothie a heads up if ye find a monster that can push you under the influence of this potion
• Sembelbin now offers name changing services (thank MiB)
- Fees start at 100gp and increase exponentially with each use of the service (to prevent abuse).

New Monsters
• monsters/wolf_ice (untested) - Winter wolf
- Winter wolf minions (30+) with freezing howl and breath attacks
• monsters/wolf_ice_alpha (untested) - Winter Alpha Wolf
- Ice wolf boss (40+)
- Summons uber blizzard (800 radius) at monster location or at the location of other/summon_point1 - if the script is present
• monsters/zombie_zygol - Zygoli, The All Seeing (level 25+ boss)
- This giant zombie is invulnerable so long as at least four of the eyes he summons are present
- Zygoli summons these at a 64 unit radius from himself on spawn, each is 32x32, the zombie itself is about 200 units high, so this boss needs a lot of room to operate.
- Zygoli is weakened as each of these eyes is destroyed, becoming increasingly vulnerable to attack, but the zombie grows a new eye every two minutes
- The Eyes of Zygoli themselves have stunning lightning attacks and use hit and run tactics coupled with partial invisibility
- Zygoli also has a necro-energy beam that slowly drags you towards him
• monsters/orc_cata_winder - Orc Catapult Winder - this big guy winds up catapults
- First entry in "params" becomes the prefix for his events (see New Mapper Toys), this allows multiple catapults to be manned by multiple winders
- Fires <params>_fire every 7 seconds, unless interrupted.
- Fires <params>_wind 1 second later, and again, 3 seconds later, to toggle the catapult winding wheel
- Fires <params>_died on death
- Kicks players away from time to time, but otherwise concentrates on his job
• monsters/doom_plant1 - Doom Plant
- A placable version of the doom plant used by the Bear God of the Forbidden Forest
- Slowly grows to a new stage every 30 seconds. Has three stages: shrub, bush, and tree, each with increasing health and variety of attacks.

New Mapper Toys
• new msmonster_XXX property: params ("Additional Paramaters")
- Allows customizability of monster though params seperated by semi-colons
- for instance: "race_human;make_invulnerable;glow_white;make_jumper" would set an orc to spawn as human faction, invulnerable, white glowshell, and jump at high targets.
- Params also have uses for setting special options on some certain scripts
- Available Params Include:
Code:
>Race Options (converts monster faction):
beloved_race - ally to all
hated_race - hated by all
demon_race - plays well with orcs and undead
evil_race - similar
good_race - player friendly
hguard_race - player nuteral, but agro if attacked
human_race
orc_race - does not play nice with undead or wild animals
rogue_race - attacks everything but its own
spider_race
undead_race - not fond of the living, but tends to ignore vermin and spiders
vermin_race
wildanimal_race

>Glowshell/Render
glow_red
glow_green
glow_blue
glow_yellow
glow_purple
glow_custom - glow_custom the next param MUST be the custom color, formatted: (RRR,GGG,BBB)
make_ghost - causes an additive render - it may cause the monster to flicker out temporarily when struck by glowshell effects

>Strength, Armor variants
make_invulnerable - Prefixes name with "Invincible", gives white glow-shell
add_10_health 
add_100_health
add_500_health
add_1000_health
double_health - Prefixes name with "Strong"
quad_health - Prefixes name with "Very Strong"

>Behavior
go_roam - Makes a normally stationary NPC roam
no_roam - Wont wander until enemy heard or spotted
critical_npc - Initiate siege system and set this as a critical NPC to defend (see Siege map system, below)

>Enhance (more pending)
demon_blood
speed_x2
speed_x3
speed_x4

>Immunities
lightning_immune
fire_immune
poison_immune
cold_immune

> There are also several monster-specific params I don't have time to go into just now. >_>

• other/web
- add the property "scriptname" with the value "other/web" to any func_wall_toggle entity with a targetname
- it will "web" any player that touches it, vanshing, and slowing them to a crawl for 10 seconds
- it will also make a sticky noise and give them the hud message "You have been webbed!"
- If someone wants a variant of this that also stops the player from attacking feel free to request
• Killtarget->msarea_monsterspawn bugs fixed
- You may now safely use trigger_relay->killtarget to remove an msarea_monsterspawn
- All the monsters tied to the spawn will fade away with it
• Siege map system (as used in old_helena)
- Giving (most) any NPC the param flag "critical_npc" activates the siege system, each NPC with this flag is critical
- (Some of the more primitive NPC's do not use the main NPC AI and thus cannot be used with this system, but most any with a store can be used.)
- When these AI's are struck or die, players will be notified. If they die from friendly fire, the offending player's name will be given.
- When siege mode is active, 1 in 3 non-human monsters ignore players in favor of NPC's, and will select a random critical NPC to hunt down.
• console command: fakehp <#>
- If not on FN, you can use this command to simulate #hp worth of players in the server to test your reqhp monster spawns

Map fixes
• The Keep
- Further efforts to ensure doors do not cause problems
• Calruin2
- Script based trigger system to replace the suddenly buggy multisource that's stopping the volcano
• Daragoth (recompile)
- Buggy ladders, buggy giant bats, buggy textures, hopefully all fixed
• Ara by J (recompile)
- Various efforts to further intensify and stabalize the Ara campaign

BugZ Squashed + Odder stuffz
• Fixed effects (eg. Poison, etc.) sticking on players post mortem (Thank MiB)
- This, however, includes beneficial effects, such as ice shield, protection, regeneration,etc.
- The cost of the affected potions have been reduced and the items made more plentiful
• Fixed some screwiness on the character selection screen (Thank MiB)
• Framework for new parry system
• Framework for new title system (Thank MiB)
• Function for changing names (Thank MiB)
• Function for altering weapon attacks (Thank MiB)
• Function for triggering weapon animations from the server side (Thank MiB)
• Ice Shield Reworked (untied from weapon reg)
- No more buggy casting
- No more "the mana returns" weirdness - it just never takes it to begin with
• XP Bug Fixes!!! ZOMG! (Thank MiB!)
- XP no longer fubars against resistance nor vulnerabilities
- XP now passes proper for most dodamage (ie. applyeffect damage, aka. DOT)
- Pretty much the only thing left to fix XP on is skeles that get back up repeatedly
• Boosted Orion bow into the anti-siege weapon it was meant to be
- Also manaballs no longer "burst" on collision with NPCs, and of course, XP passes proper
- Bugger still jams up during firing sometimes though, trick seems to be not to spam it too fast
• Crossbolts are now hitscan weapons
- Dwarven Crossbolts now also have AOE damage - but are less accurate than the others
- Crossbows now have their own limitless generic bolt
- Bugger has exposed some issues with civilian, guard, and bandit hitboxes, but otherwise seems to work well
• Fixed Crest of the Mushroom Kingdom crashing when placed in container (name was too long)
• Some higher-definition civlian models (Thank Orochi and Little-G)
• Temporarily nerfed the Pheonix Armor until we get the new parry system in (quit yer bitching!)
- I've increased the XP value of several bosses, and this makes it far too exploitable
- It currently returns MP instead of health, in addition to total immunity to fire
• Knife special attack now increases attack speed as well (as I *think* was originally intended)
- It's also been reduced to once every 40 seconds to avoid abuse through "chaining"
• After two years, the "WOrth" bug has finally been fixed! (Thank MiB)
- Wish I thought of looking in titles.txt :|

• And the usual 10,000 bug fixes I'm not bothering to mention
