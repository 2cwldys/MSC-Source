Re: List of changelogs

JUN2007a PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

pic of the month
uber_reaver.gif

Most of this month's stuff is scripts for new maps. This bumped pretty much everything else over to next month.

New Stuffz
• show_health - settings for show_health now save to character (Vista disease spreaders rejoice)
• summon_help - forgot your summon commands? Type this in chat or console to list them in console/combat hud
• Improved shields a bit
- Shields can now deflect most any incoming attack, even fire, poison spit, etc.
- They cannot, however, block the DOT from such effects
- (ie. shield may deflect a fire ball's impact but not the ambient burn damage.)
gold.gif
• Seperate gold tiles in chests (finally)
- When there are multiple players, pouches of gold now appear in groups inside chests (rather than just one huge wad)
- Like potions, they can stack, so ya might want to check the same chest again after taking one
- These do not add to your inventory, but add gold directly to your character
- You must have as double the hp as there is gold in the to pick it up (PL prevention)
- More players = more gold pouches per chest
- Only applied to a few chests now, soon to be everywhere
• Health bars!
- Health bars appear over players heads
- Health bars appear over monsters heads, with a special ring
- Monster health bars scale based on total monster total HP, like so:
hpbar_small.gif Orc Warrior = 60 total hp
hpbar_big.gif Djinn Ji'ax = 3000 total hp
- Known bug: sometimes monster healthbars pop up "inside" monsters due to improper or false height defines
- This bit also needs some aesthetic work
- I've made the system dymamic, so we could use a sprite with more frames (up to 100)
- health_bars 0 in console to disable player health bars (this setting saves to character)
- To disable monster health bars: put away the ring. ^_^
• New flight AI
- Bats move almost realistically, and if you thought Horrors were annoying before...
- Giant bat got a bit of of a "revamp" too (semi re-write)
• Ring of the Bloodstone (in game)
- Allows seeing health bars over the head of monsters when they are struck
- Result of an insanely complicated 13 step quest...

New Beasties
• monsters/uber_reaver - Ice Reaver Patriarch
- A gigantic ice reaver, enhanced by the magics of Maldora, level 40'ish mini-boss
- AOE stun, lightning attack, massive perpetual blizzard attack, quadruple freeze sphere attack, big ol bag of hp
• monsters/skeleton_crystal1
- Invulnerable escort for the uber_reaver, comes and goes
- Must be tied to the a repeatable monsterspawn named "summon_skels" with 1 life for proper function with uber_reaver
• monsters/troll_ice_lobber
- This troll lobber tosses giant snow boulders that break into fields of deadly ice spikes
- Good for juicing up level 40'ers
- Demon faction for easy placement (gets along with both undead and orcs)
• monsters/troll_ice_lobber_turret
- non-roaming variant of same
• monsters/sorc_chief1 - Runegahr, Shahaddar Orc Chieften (WIP)
- Semi-functional, but not quite ready for prime time. Can actually fight, but want a few more abilities.
- ATM he has various lightning attacks, a vampiric sword, and the ability to teleport
• monsters/sorc_telepoint1 (monsters/sorc_telepoint2,monsters/sorc_telepoint3,monsters/sorc_telepoint4)
- Places these on the map with Runegahr, or any other Shahaddar, and they will periodically teleport to them and/or their spawn point
- Creatures near teleport points will be catapulted away just before the orc arrives
- Multiply orcs can be used as each teleport point as a built in "cool down" time
• NPCs: "NPCs/james" and "NPCs/tao" for Dridge's upcoming map

New Mapper Toys
• Script error reporting - pop-ups tell ya when you spelled a script name wrong

BugZ Squashed + Odder stuffz
• Fixed bug where Maldora was vulnerable to demon blood and a few other magics
• Fixed Blacksmith "swinging at air" and similar range issues
• Fixed a bunch of anim errors
• Fixed some crashes involved with gold bags spawning
• Some more no free edict control
• Eight hours of "doing olypmix" brain death prevention (cross fingers)
- Also revamped the Ice Djinn a bit while I was at it, as he made a good test subject
• Better ***mod<->FN detection
• Fixed dibilitating poison immunities
- Also reduced poison time on g.poison arrows for mercy's sake
• Tweaks to the chain lightning effect (still uses wave effect though)
• Cut down on lag during black slime splits
• Drastically reduced lag caused by mass monster spawnage
• Fixed client-side health sprite corruption (possibly... maybe...)
• Improved ice wall responsiveness and agro trigger
• Improved poison cloud responsiveness
• Some improvement to the elemental resistance system
- Removing a resistant item for one element will no longer cancel the resistance of another
- Combining two items that resist the same element still causes wierdness though
• Fixed some more PVP issues
- including bit with the bone blade not working on players, I hope
• Guards no longer constantly turn to face players
- Wasn't a bug so much as an unintended feature, but it had potential issues
• Fixed bug where bandit archers (first three types) sometimes caused server crash
• Fixed bug where Voldar and Maldora would sometimes not start convos when players near by
• Watch yer step on Bloodrose, fall damage is on (by Foamy's request)
• Fixed up skele dead-by-holy fade effect
• Holy magics determine valid targets by vulnerability instead of race (new dll function)
- There were a few creatures who wern't vulnerable and should have been, this should fix that
• Lots, and lots, and lots of anti-cheat stuff
- This includes, most importantly, the fact that FN will no longer accept connections from older DLLs, as they are HIGHLY exploitable

- Anti-Whore(/ninja/pirate/cannibal/viking) -
• Switched gold bags to spawn by x#bags/player present
• Gold is split into multiple tiles base on players present*
• Gold multiplies based on #players presnet*
• Increased rewards for multiple players*
• Increased spawn chance of rares by # of players present*
• On some chests, if there more than a certain # of "worthy" players present, extra random items will appear
• "random bolts" chances increase based on # of players present
• Some rewards exclusive to multi-player games
• Chests can only be opened by the same player once every two seconds
• Some items require a player with certain attributes to appear in chests
- Meaning, if yer a nub, let the vets get the first pick, and maybe something better will be in there
• Artifiact Chests appear and determine most worthy players for some high end items
* = only some chests in some areas, to be applied to all chests in the future

- AMX Changes -
• AMX Map vote now activates when ANYONE presses [enter] on a transition
• AMXmodX adaptation pending...

- MAP Updates -
• The Keep
- Removed sounds from rotating doors to prevent crashes when they are jammed by monsters
- Caused fist bandit door to be more dependable (monster spawn there is spawnstart 0 = this is BAD)
- Addded future transition place holder to prevent sploit
• Wicard Oven
- Added monsterclip to prevent Voldar from vaulting over the gate where you can't get to him

- Installer Changes -
(nadda)

...and the usual 10,000 minor changes I'm not bothering to list...

Bumped to next month (in order of priority):
- Crow's skycastle2 scripts (almost done! ><)
- Helena NPC post invasion award (complicated, and likely made pointless by Helena2)
- AMX vote re-write (now part of the AMXmodX project)
- Alter chain lighting to work more like, well, chain lightning
- Shadahar revamp (bumped for fifth month in a row)
- New Swim AI (really people, just put monster clips on the water, tis how HL1 monsters work)
- Mining System (doesn't look like Vomica wants to work on his map anymore :( )
- Single Player Mode (adjust for single player + not on central server)

* Known bug:
• If you remove your armor, and replace it, you will be invisible in third person.
- Type 'vis' to remedy. If you do not type vis, your armor should appear correctly to other players.
• Warning: Unable to open sound/npc/RND_SAYX.wav for transfer
- Server message, bug with how the "say" script command works in MSC, no worries
