The following is a series of changelogs starting from MAY2006 and continuing to the current public release. Some links in older changelogs maybe unavailable, and the formatting may not always be consistent. New changelogs will be added here as they occur, in addition to the beta-pack news thread.

There were a few patches before May 2006, but they were mostly centered around fixing technical issues (including a memory leak) without any changes to actual game play nor expansion of the world. Seems there's no surviving record of the exact changes involved in those few patches. Versions of Master Sword predating January 2005 are "Pre-Continued" and thus not included (ie. MS 1.35). I would like to get together a better history of the game though, as it goes as far back as 1998.

(Let's all thank Zeus for getting this put together.)

New Mapper Scripts:
weather/timer
- This triggers map events every hour: hour_1, hour_2, hour_3, to hour_23 and so forth.
- At hour_6, it also triggers is_dawn
- At hour_17, it also triggers is_dusk (re: sunset)
- At hour_20 it also triggers is_night
- place as an ms_npc anywhere on your map
- Can be combined with the following four scripts:
weather/always_day
- locks the TOD at NOON
- if the hour advances more than an hour, for whatever reason, it should reset to noon within a few seconds
- must be used in conjunction with weather/timer
- weather/timer will no longer 'chime' hours when this ms_npc is present - however, it will call an event called hour_counter for each hour that would have passed were the script not active.
weather/always_dusk - as always_day, but locks the time at 17:00 (sunset)
weather/always_night - as always_night, but locks the time at midnight
weather/no_weather - kills all weather effects at the top of every hour or would be hour (untested), must be combined with weather/timer

weather/always_rain - should make it almost always rain (untested)
weather/always_snow - should make it almost always snow (untested - and I've never seen snow)
weather/make_fog - should make fog, but untested (probably wont work, may have to add to weather/timer
weather/no_rain - should disable all rain (untested)
weather/no_snow - should disable all snow (untested)
weather/sfx_weather_rain - fixed error, added flag
weather/sfx_weather_rain_storm - fixed error, added flag
weather/sfx_weather_snow - added flag

player/emote_sit&stand
- Health regen rate is a now 5% of your maximum heal while sitting (minimum 2pts)
- Mana regen rate is a now 20% of your maximum mana while sitting (minimum 4pts)
- You cannot regen for 10 seconds (or so) after being struck.
- This means no more sitting around for hours to regen/recharge
