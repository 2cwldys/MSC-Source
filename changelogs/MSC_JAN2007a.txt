Re: List of changelogs

January 1st 2007 Public Changelog
Public Changelog JAN2007a:
- Major SC.DLL Changes: -
New Stuffz
Anti-cheat map system to filter maps and prevent unauth alteration of current maps
Integrated the rest of Orochi's Model Pack
Gave Kale and the old maid a make-over
Stun resistance reports when struck (roll%/resistance%)
Parry success reports (parry_roll / attacker_roll) - helps gauge shield effectiveness
You may now click +use on any npc that uses base_chat (ie. most of them) to bring up the NPC interaction menu (some quests still need work though)
Keyhole menus activate with +use (still got those buggy hitboxes, but this helps some)
Volcano Blade - A firey wicked blade (viewmodel is buggy - spec attack needs work)
Flame Lick - A dagger forged from the tounge of an efreeti (viewmodel is buggy)
Urdulian Shield - A massive shield forged from the gates of a fallen Temple of Urdual
New scarey voices for the ice queen
New bank armor/weapon storage system
Bank Limitations
- Items/Tickets must be in your hands to be stored/redeemed (banker will remind you of this)
- If you have two of a storable item, you'll need to drop one to store it (even if it's not in your hands)
- If you have two of the same ticket type, you'll need to drop one to redeem it (even if it's not in your hands)
- Due to naming conventions, tickets will go into the same type of container/sheath of the type of item replaced
- Bank requires map updates to function

New Beasties
monsters/anim_warrior_hard_fire - meaner, infernal animated armor
monsters/anim_warrior_hard_thunder - mean animated armor with lightning effects
monsters/anim_warrior_hard_frost - mean animated armor with frost effects
monsters/anim_warrior_hard_random - one of the above three selected at random
monsters/fallen_armor - new mega-boss "Armor of The Fallen"
