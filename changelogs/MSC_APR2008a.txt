Re: List of changelogs

APR2008a PUBLIC CHANGELOG:

New Stuffs:
• The Wolve's Bane
- A special light silver shortsword enchanted with wolvesbane
- Double damage vs. wolves
• Blood Drinker
- Is now in game. Sword uses basically the same script Runeghar's uses, so expect similar targeting/wallh4x behavior.
- You can use your fists while the sword is dancing (can't kick, but will work on that).
- Right click to make the sword return sooner.
- Level Requirements - base: 30, x2_dmg_stab: 32, throw: 34
[Would have added Fire Tomahawk and Dark Bone Blade, but model consolidation is not complete - Shard of Felewyn is complete, but not in game, yet]

Map Changes
• Sfor has been expanded on
- Didn't want to make nightmare_sfor without doing something for the mid-level folk too, so there's a whole new wing on Sfor, just for them
- Undamael area also available for examination (you can play with him, but the quest is not complete, he cannot be defeated - note the mirror damage)
- This was a rush job, I hope to come back and polish it later
• B_Castle is now connected to Sfor
- There are also two new open transitions in Sfor

New Map Support For Soon TBR's:
• Ocean Crossing
• Smuggler's Cove
• Verath
• Nightmare Sfor

New Beasties:
• monsters/fire_spider_spitting - Fire Spider
- Big shiny red spider, shoots bolts of fire
• monsters/fire_spider_turret
- Ditto, but doesn't move
• monsters/fire_spider_mini - Fire spider hatchling
- Only has 10hp but is guaranteed to be the most annoying beast since the Horror
- Latches onto your body or face at random locations, biting, and hindering your movement - must be "scraped off"
• monsters/fire_reaver_mini- Fire Reaver Hatchling
- A small fire reaver whose little volcano isn't old enough to be active, but it still has a taste for burning flesh.
• monsters/slime_green - Lesser green slime
- Bugger's hit and run projectile tactics make him hard to catch, he may yet chew on your poisoned corpse

Mapper Toys:
• other/cannon_manned
- This cannon can be aimed in a 45 degree arc and fires a single 1000hp cannon ball every 30 seconds
• other/cannon_manned_fixed
- This cannon cannot be aimed and requires it be loaded with item_cannon_ball before fireing
• other/trigger_poison
- Brush scriptname poisons players that touch it. Targetname becomes the name of the attacker, target: <dmg>;<time>;[no_monsters]
• other/trigger_burn
- Convention alias for burn_1000, adjustable, same params as trigger_poison
• other/trigger_web
- Convention alias for web, no params, just targets itself.
• other/undamael_hurt, other/undamael_break, other/undamael_pitedge
- These are for Undamael operations - see Undamael documentation [pending]

Fixes/Changes:
• All corpses now fade properly, and within 20 seconds, instead of two minutes
- Should save a mess load of edicts in swarm situations, such as old_helena
• Some viewmodel consolidation (bows, 2h swords, shields, potions)
- Should also free up some edicts
- Also optimized them a bit to save some epoly's
• Fixed map sploit where dmgmulti would sometimes work when set to less than 1
• Fixed client 255 msg bug
- Or at least got it to the point where I can't duplicate it anymore. >_>

...and the usual 100,000 changes I'm not bothering to list.
