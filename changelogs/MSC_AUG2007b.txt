Re: List of changelogs

AUG2007b SUPLEMENTAL CHANGELOG:

• Reduced Lightning Skeleton Lag (both in attack and scan)
• Reduced Air Elemental Lag
• Fixed maps monster ramping when they shouldn't
• Changed monster ramp to work by "Party Strength" (ie. total HP of players on server) rather than number of players
• Fixed bug where some monsters were ramping twice
• Chest give_chance fixes (not entirely tested)
• Artifact Chest Fixes
- In addition to no longer repeatedly giving items to the same guy the AC's now randomly sort their inventory
- So the most powerful guy does not always get the same item
• Re-Centered Air Elemental Model for smoother flight (also no longer immune to fire)
• Re-Centered anim_archer_hard model for smoother flight
- Fixed subsequent bit with flying archers getting into floors, and improved AI
• Hack to fix locked chests (if a chest does lock, give it a minute, it may fix itself)
• Improved chest's player counting
• Put Evaan's weapon restrictions at full strength
- Against my better judgement, but hey, you guys voted for it. ;)
- If you run into someone who has no weapons they can use, remind them that they can sell some weapons to downgrade
• monsters/bludgeon_gaz1_mini - Young Bludgeon
- Awww! They iz so kewt! Ow! They hurt!
- Special request for Little-G's/Frodo's new map
- Variants include: monsters/bludgeon_gaz2_mini monsters/bludgeon_gaz1_demon_mini monsters/bludgeon_gaz2_demon_mini
- (basically take any existing gaz bludgeon and stick _mini on the end)
• Added the missing bludgeon soundset

Mapper Toys
• other/kill_all_monsters - guess what this does when you spawn it
- Good for ridding a boss of his left over minions when he dies, without the usual bugs
• new msmonster_XXX/ms_npc entity property "title"
- Change a monsters name to whatever ya want
- May add abilities to change HP, Damage, Race, model, or pass params in future!
- FGD updated for this
• Fixed bug with "reqhp" feature (accidentally put in "hpreq")
• world map event: mstime_XX
- The event mstime_xx will fire every game world hour
- ( so mstime_17 goes off at dusk, mstime_20 at eve, and mstime_6 in the morning)
- In addition hour_counter will fire every game world hour
- (This makes weather/timer obsolete)
