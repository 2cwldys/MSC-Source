monsters/lure - a 32x32 invisible monster you can use to attract any agro monsters to a specific location (they will percieve it as an enemy and attack it). It fires the event " lure_died " when it is slain, but you can also tie killtarget ("target when killed") to it as you would any other monster. You canNOT place it *inside* breakables to make monsters break them - as the monster can't see it inside a solid entity - but you can place this just outside and the monster will go for it - then simply trigger the breakable when it dies.
